# Hello, Next.js!

You can import and use React components in MDX files.

Today, Roblox provides creators with a platform that enables end-to-end tools, services, and support to help them build the most immersive 3D experiences. With Roblox Studio, creators have everything they need, out-of-the-box and for free, to build their experiences and publish immediately on all popular platforms, reaching 58.8 million people daily worldwide. With the advent of generative AI techniques, however, we are seeing an opportunity to revolutionize creation on the platform, both by augmenting Roblox Studio to make creation dramatically faster and easier, and also by enabling every user on Roblox to be a creator.

As we all know, generative AI learns the underlying patterns and structures of data and generates new content, such as images, audio, code, text, 3D models, or other forms of media, that have not been seen before. With a dramatic acceleration in these tools’ effectiveness for everyday content creation, this technology is at an inflection point. It now has the capability to capture the creator’s intent, provide a broad range of digital editing capabilities, help create the content, and allow for fast iteration. We have already heard from Roblox creators about how they are using this technology to create. However, these off-the-shelf AI systems are not integrated with our platform and they often do not produce “Roblox ready” output that requires substantial follow on work from a creator. We see an incredible opportunity to build generative AI tools and APIs focused on Roblox.

## The Value of Generative AI for Our Creators

Today a Roblox experience is created through a combination of 3D objects of various forms (constructive solid geometry, avatars, meshes, terrain, etc), connected in behavior through Lua scripting, and backed by a universal physics engine that provides core behavior on the platform. While the engine is an underlying portion of the platform, it is up to the creator to build or otherwise acquire everything in the experience. We see generative AI tools being applicable to each of these different creative processes. What we have already started to see through internal prototypes is that specialized generative AI tools can not only accelerate creator productivity, but can significantly drop the technical skill needed to bring ideas to life.

For example, some creators know how to code, but may have limited experience creating high-fidelity 3D models. Others may be more experienced with model design, but less experienced with code. In both cases, we see a future in which even a beginner (such as myself for example – I’m a terrible artist!) can get a running head start as they look to bring their imagination to life in a Roblox experience.

Even more powerful, the convergence of media supported by generative AI will allow creators to develop integrated 3D objects that come with behavior built in. For example, a creator could design a car through a simple statement such as “A red, two seater, convertible sports car with front-wheel drive”. This new creation would both look like a red sports car but also have all the behavior coded into it to be driven through a 3D virtual world.
